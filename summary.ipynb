These formulas can also generate correct outputs for most other inputs from the same or a similar statistical distribution as the training data.\\n\\nThe book emphasizes that machines do not learn in the same way as animals. If a machine is trained to play a video game by looking straight at the screen, it will not be able to play the game on a rotated screen unless it was also trained to recognize rotation.\\n\\nThe term \"machine learning\" is used to refer to the science and engineering of building machines capable of doing various useful things without being explicitly programmed to do so.\\n\\nThe book is divided into three parts:\\n\\n1. Introduction: This part provides an overview of machine learning, including its different types (supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning) and how supervised learning works.\\n\\n2. Notation and Definitions: This part reviews mathematical notation and definitions used in machine learning, including vectors, matrices, sets, functions, derivatives, gradients, and probability distributions.\\n\\n3. Fundamental Algorithms: This part describes five fundamental machine learning algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and k-nearest neighbors.\\n\\nThe book is written in a clear and concise style, with a focus on practical applications. It is intended for beginners in machine learning who want to gain a solid understanding of the field.\\n\\nAdditionally, the book covers advanced topics such as learning to rank, learning to recommend, self-supervised learning, and word embeddings. These topics provide a deeper understanding of machine learning and its applications in various domains.'"
